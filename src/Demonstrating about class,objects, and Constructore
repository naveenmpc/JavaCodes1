Creating a class
‚óè	A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

Example :


public class Dog {
   String breed;
   int age;
   String color;

   void barking() {
   }

   void hungry() {
   }

   void sleeping() {
   }}

 Creating an object:

---If we consider the real world, we can find many objects around us, such as cars, dogs, humans, and so on. All these objects have a state and behavior.
--If we consider a dog, then its state is: name, breed, color, and the behavior is: barking, wagging the tail, and running.
--If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.
--Software objects also have a state and behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.
--So, in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.


public class Puppy {
   public Puppy(String name) {
      // This constructor has one parameter, name.
      System.out.println("Passed Name is :" + name );
   }

   public static void main(String []args) {
      // Following statement would create an object myPuppy
      Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy( "tommy" );
   }}


Constructor:


--When discussing about classes, one of the most important subtopics would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
--each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.
